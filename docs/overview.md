\# Project Overview: Big Data Smart Home



\## 1. Introduction

This project was developed as part of the Big Data and Database Systems module at LSBU.  

It focuses on the design, implementation, and analysis of a \*\*Smart Home data environment\*\*, combining SQL databases, Tableau visualizations, and structured reporting.  



The aim is to demonstrate how data from IoT and smart devices can be stored, queried, and visualized to provide insights into energy efficiency, user behavior, and system performance.

\## 2. Data Sources

\- \*\*SQL Database (`SMART\_HOME\_LSBU.sql`)\*\*  

&nbsp; Contains multiple tables simulating smart home device data (e.g., sensors, energy usage, user profiles).  

&nbsp; Implemented in MySQL, normalized for consistency, and designed with scalability in mind.



\- \*\*Tableau Workbooks (`LSBU Smart Home.twb`)\*\*  

&nbsp; Visualizations built on top of the database, including:  

&nbsp; - Energy consumption trends  

&nbsp; - Device usage frequency  

&nbsp; - Smart home efficiency KPIs

\## 3. Tools and Technologies

\- \*\*SQL (MySQL)\*\* – Database design, schema definition, and data queries.  

\- \*\*Tableau\*\* – Data visualization and dashboard design.  

\- \*\*Python (optional, exploratory)\*\* – Pandas/Numpy for preprocessing if required.  

\- \*\*Microsoft Word / PDF\*\* – Final academic report documenting the process.

\## 5. Key Insights

\- A relational database schema enables efficient data storage and querying for smart home systems.  

\- Tableau dashboards provide clear insights into energy and device usage.  

\- The project demonstrates how \*\*Big Data principles\*\* can be applied to real-world IoT scenarios.  



---



\## 6. Limitations and Future Work

\- Dataset size is limited (simulated data).  

\- Real-world applications would require integration with live IoT data streams.  

\- Future improvements could include predictive modeling (e.g., energy consumption forecasting with ML).
